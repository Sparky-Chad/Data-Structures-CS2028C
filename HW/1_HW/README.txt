Homework 1, created by Chad Lape

File uses a plain version of cpp and contains a precompiled executable which should, theoretically, be all thats needed to
run on windows. If that does not work, use mingw g++ or throw into visual studio and that should work to compile. Ensure 
the terminal is running from the file with everything in it and the program should work fine.
