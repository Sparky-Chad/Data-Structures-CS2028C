\section{Compiling and Using}
	Rather then compile, included within the folder is an executable of the homework. This should be able to run on the windows environment without any hassle. Otherwise it would be recomended to use g++, mingw g++ for windows, to compile the program and run it. Ensure that any files being read from are within the same folder as there should not be any major issues if this is doneS
	
\section{Group Members}
	Chad and Colton had assumed, wrongly, that the homework was to be done seperately and for this homework assignment the work presented represents the coding which was done by Chad Lape. Colton was submitting seperately with their own code they had created.
